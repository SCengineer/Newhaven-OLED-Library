# Newhaven-OLED-Library
Arduino Library for Newhaven character slim OLEDs that use the US2066 controller such as the NHD0420-AX3 and NHD0220CW-Ax3, NHD0216CW-Ax3 using hardware SPI.

This extends on the work done by Pasquale D'Antini (2015) and Joakim Sandstr√∂m (2016)
by packaging it into an Arduino library and adding Print functionality.
